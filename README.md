## 🚀 What I Would Improve with More Time

I would elevate Soulify into a full-stack mental wellness and spiritual companion platform by integrating the following features:

🌱 Core Feature Expansions
Manifestation Board
Core feature – daily affirmations to be completed twice a day at specific times.
Functionality: Alarm, pop-up reminders, ability to attach images and notes.

Daily Affirmations

Daily Horoscope

Tarot Readings
Through AI + option for personal (paid) readings via platform integration after initial free use.

Healing Tracker
Small goal progress tracker (e.g., 40-day healing journeys).
Achieved or not tracking logic.

Chakra Alignment
AI-powered chakra diagnosis via symptom analysis with solution suggestions.
Post-recovery maintenance tracking.
Optional paid chakra reader support.

Next Manifestation Trigger
After one manifestation is achieved, prompt and guide for the next.

Soak in Positivity Page
Daily AI-curated content (videos, quotes, visual inspiration, etc.).

Meditation Mode
Personalized sound and visual environments.
Sound options: Water, birds, air, natural elements.

Feeling Low Pop-Up
Triggered via AI and user permissions (like Instagram).
Shows:
a. Lightweight content (memes, positive affirmations).
b. “What to do now” – general and personalized suggestions.

Avatar (Bestie/Brocode Mode)
Conversational tab with an AI avatar to talk to, vent, and share anything freely.

## 💻 Technical Improvements

Convert to a Full-Stack Application using Node.js, MongoDB, and Express for data persistence (e.g., saving user goals, mood logs).

Integrate Redux Toolkit for scalable state management.

Add an AI-powered Chatbot using OpenAI API for daily guidance, tarot reading simulation, or emotional check-ins.

Implement user authentication and cloud storage for personalized experience.

Improve performance and SEO using best practices like code splitting, lazy loading, and meta optimization.

Add unit testing (Jest) and Cypress for E2E testing.
