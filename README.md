## What I Would Improve with More Time
**make it a full stack applicaton** by adding:

* manifestation board(core --> an affirmation that is to be done twice daily at a certain point of time daily 
     [functionality : alarm ,pop-up])images, notes
*daily affirmations
*daily horoscope
*tarot readings through AI also personal readings(platform to paid readers after an initial breakpoint)
*healing (progress tracker {small goals})
*achieved or not  (every 40 days)
*chakras alignment
through AI symptoms and solutions-->maintenance once recovered 
again tracker for solution or paid opt for paid reader for chakra cleansing
*after a manifestation achieved --> time for next
*soak in positivity page(daily videos etc etc[AI])
*a special mode for meditation with different sounds 
    -water -birds -air -natural sound and visuals personalized according to user
*feeling low pop-up (after taking some permissions and ai integration[like of Instagram])
    -providing light weight content  OR
    -things you should do now(a. generalized b. personalized acc to current info AI)
*AVATAR -a bestie/brocode type avatar a special tab for this where you can spit out any dam thing.
